<h4><i>PREFACE</i></h4>

<p><i>The material forming the greater part of
the present monograph is reprinted verbatim
et literatim from certain portions of volume
1, Numbers 1, 2, and 3, Washington, November
30, 1876, of Foster&#8217;s</i> <span class="smcap">Indian Record and
Historical Data</span>. <i>The complete work so
far as carried out consists only of the three
parts here mentioned, printed in folio and
comprising four numbered pages each. The
editor, Dr. Thomas Foster, who termed himself
&#8220;Indian historiographer&#8221; hoped to be
able to publish the sheet weekly &#8220;should
funds permit.&#8221; Evidently lack of finances
or the small amount of interest shown in the
venture determined against its continuance
as it ceased with the third issue.</i></p>

<p><i>During Foster&#8217;s connection with the Indian
Bureau at Washington, John Q. Smith
held the position of Commissioner of Indian
Affairs and it is not improbable looked with
little favor on the scheme. In any event the</i>
<span class="smcap">Record</span> <i>is a desideratum in most collections
and as such, even a portion of it may not be</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
<i>amiss in this reprint. Unfortunately its
short existence did not permit of finishing
the sketches of the Iowa or Winnebago,
though it would appear that in the instance
of the former but little more would have been
added. It is hoped however, that in the foreword
the more necessary data are given and
that it is appropriately terminated.</i></p>

<p><i>The actual worth of the</i> <span class="smcap">Indian Record</span> <i>is
slight. Foster&#8217;s idea with reference to several
monographs relating wholly or in part
to certain tribes was a worthy one and
could be executed to advantage even at this
date. The two treatises attempted in his
short-lived publication were on the Iowa and
their parent stock, the Winnebago, although
several shorter tribal sketches, as for example
those on the Attacapa,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Oroyelles,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Arapahoes,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
and Eries<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> are included among other
features, these being as scattered notes</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
<i>through the forty-eight columns and of more
or less value, particularly as concerns the
linguistics.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> It is evident from his Introduction
that Foster must have had many difficulties
to contend with, especially in the
matter of procuring suitable faces of type
for his Indian vocabularies as well as in the
matter of actual printing. At the best the
work is poorly done. The proof-reading is
wretched and the statements of fact often in
grave error. Abject carelessness in the matter
of transcription appears without excuse,
hence quoted portions through the present
text have invariably been read and compared
with the originals, obviously enhancing the
value of such a reissue. Although a
praiseworthy effort for the period and due
every consideration at this time, a project of
the kind attempted today would fail ingloriously
unless handled with requisite care.</i></p>

<p><i>In the absence of any cognate facts referring
in detail to the Iowa tribe it has been
deemed best to reprint Foster&#8217;s sketch in its
entirety from the</i> Record <i>and to add to it, as</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
<i>appendices, some features which will be of
special interest and value to the student of
American aboriginal history and ethnology.
In this textual portion will be found much
from Schoolcraft&#8217;s</i> <span class="smcap">Indian Tribes of the
United States</span>, <i>also extracts, some of considerable
length, from the first volume of
the Minnesota Historical Society&#8217;s</i> <span class="smcap">Collections,
1850-56</span>, <i>and Neill&#8217;s</i> <span class="smcap">History of Minnesota</span>.
<i>Nevertheless such facts as are garnered
from sources of this character although
purloined, are to be welcomed, and in
a certain sense it may be considered fortunate
that all of the material is not wholly original.</i></p>

<p><i>In the introductory sketch following this,
an attempt has been made to gather all material
readily available on the Iowa tribe. The
writer acknowledges his indebtedness to the
Bureau of American Ethnology, without assistance
from which no authentic or in any
way exhaustive sketch on any subject connected
with the Indian question could be accomplished.
The many references in the
form of foot-notes have been verified with
the greatest care. In many instances the
meanings in the original are ambiguous. In
the present form this fault is rectified and it</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
<i>is hoped that the concise yet lucid account of
this important branch of the great Siouan
family may assist in giving it some of that
prominence to which it should rightfully aspire.
A list of some of the more famous
warriors is included as an appendix, and
though incomplete and taken in part from
printed records it will show that the tribe
numbered among its members men who were
famous outside of their own precincts, and
these names may inspire some future historian
to delve even more deeply into those archives
that are known to be only memoirs of
a past existence.</i></p>

<p><i>Students of Iowa history or of the Indians
of the central west can ill afford to overlook
a work on the Indian tribes by A. R.
Fulton entitled</i> <span class="smcap">The Red Men of Iowa</span>. <i>The
volume is now scarce but fortunately the
writer has been able to use it and is glad to
acknowledge its excellence. To Worthington
C. Ford, of the Massachusetts Historical
Society, and to W. H. Holmes, of the Smithsonian
Institution, James Mooney and F. W.
Hodge of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
he is also indebted and wishes publicly to
express his thanks for their kindly interest.</i></p>

from a curious practice adopted by the Iowa
after battle. Mooney also advocates this

the Sioux and not to the whole Siouan stock
and is doubtful as to the common interpretation
of the sign&#8212;a sweeping motion of

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
<i>&#8220;Necklace People.&#8221; He also says that this
tribe was a little too far from the plains to
have a special sign and were probably
merged with the Oto, Missouri, Sauk and others
in the general region of the &#8220;shaved
heads.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>The Iowa tribe of Indians forms one of
the Southwestern branches of the great Dakota
or Siouan stock and has been included
both linguistically and ethnographically by
careful students, with the Oto and the Missouri
tribes, forming the so-called Chiwere
group.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> The real difference existing between
the tribes here noted is one of dialect only.
Traditional evidence proves conclusively
that they sprung originally from that stem
which appears to have been the parent stock
of certain other southwestern Siouan tribes,
notably, the Winnebago, and from direct information
obtained from their people as late
as 1883, investigators have been told that not
only the Iowa, Missouri, and Oto tribes were
from the same source but that the Ponca and
Omaha could without question be included,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>having &#8220;once formed part of the Winnebago
Nation.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>From their primal home, to the north of
the Great Lakes, as tradition has it, came the
forebears of these tribes. Attracted by the
abundance of fish, the Winnebago halted on
the shores of Lake Michigan, while the other
bands continued southwestward, eventually
coming to the Mississippi. At this point another
division took place and it was here that
the Iowa separated from the larger group,
and it is also at this period that they received
the name of Pahoja or Gray Snow.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>out
stopping for any length of time after
separating from their comrades, the Iowa
continued down the general course of the
Mississippi until Rock River (in Illinois)
was reached. At this point as in most of the
early history of the tribe we must depend
largely on hearsay. Certain traditions however,
place them farther north. Waw-non-que-skoona-a&#8217;s
map, drawn in 1848, shows
their movements quite clearly until that date.
It is hardly necessary to reiterate statements
here that appear textually in connection with
the cartographical features, especially as
these successive movements are of comparatively
recent date and considered to be substantially
correct. There is a tradition still
popular among the Sioux that when their ancestors
first came to the Falls of St. Anthony
the Iowa tribe occupied the country adjacent
to the Minnesota river and that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>Cheyenne<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> occupied territory farther up
the same stream.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>On the arrival of Le Sueur in 1701 for the
purpose of erecting his fort near the mouth
of the Blue Earth river, many of the tribe
were found and messengers were sent to invite
them to settle in the vicinity of the stockade,
because of their excellence in farming
and general husbandry. Those despatched
for this purpose found however, that the Indians
had recently moved westward toward
the Missouri river and wished to be closer to
the Omaha who then dwelt in that region.
The tribes with whom Le Sueur came in contact
informed him that the river upon which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>he was about to settle belonged to the Sioux
of the West (Dakota), the Ayavois (Iowa),
and the Otoctatas (Oto), who lived nearby.
Probably the first among the whites to come
in actual contact with the Iowa, was P&eacute;re
Andr&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> who referred to them in 1676, at
which time they were situated about 200
miles west of Green Bay, Wisconsin. The
next reference made by a European seems
to be that of Father Zenobius Membr&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> in
1680, who mentions the Authontontas (Oto),
Nadouessious Maskoutens (Iowa)<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> &#8220;about
130 leagues from the Illinois river in three
great villages built near a river which empties
into the Colbert (Mississippi) on the
west side above the Illinois, almost opposite
the mouth of the Wisconsin.&#8221; He also seems
to locate a portion of the Aiuoves (probably
Aioues) to the west of the Milwaukee river.
On Marquette&#8217;s manuscript map which accompanied
his Journal, 1673,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> the Pahoutet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>(Iowa) are placed on or near the Missouri
river, in close company with the Maha, (Omaha)
and Ontontana (Oto). This is no doubt
conjecture on the part of the cartographer.
The Sieuer de la Salle knew of both Oto and
Iowa, and in his Hennepin letter of August
22, 1682, he refers to them as Otoutanta and
Atounauea respectively. He further states
that one of his company<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> was familiar with
the languages of both these tribes, which,
however, is doubtful.</p>

<p>When Le Sueur first supplied these Indians
with firearms in 1700 they were situated
at the extreme headquarters of the Des
Moines river, though from the translation of
this explorer&#8217;s narrative, as contained in
<span class="smcap">Wis. Hist. Coll.</span>, Vol. XVI, it would seem
that this band and the Oto removed and &#8220;established
themselves toward the Missouri
river, near the Maha.&#8221; In Jefferys&#8217; <span class="smcap">French
Dominions in North and South America</span>,
1760, the Iowa are located on the Mississippi
in latitude 43&deg; 30&#8217;. His map however places
them on the east side of the Missouri, west
of the sources of the Des Moines river and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>above the Oto, who were on the west side of
the Missouri and below the Omaha.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> According
to Lewis &amp; Clark&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Travels, etc.</span>,
(Coues&#8217; edition, 1893), their villages consisted
&#8220;of 300 men ... on the river De Moines.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
The map by Waw-non-que-skoona-a as included
in Schoolcraft and reproduced here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>with,
gives the final stopping place of the
Iowa at a point near the junction of the Wolf
and Missouri rivers, within the limits of the
present State of Nebraska. Some authorities
give their final location as being in two
villages, one on the Platte<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> and another on
the Great Nemaha river, from which places
they conducted traffic with the traders from
St. Louis, dealing principally in beaver, otter,
racoon, deer, and bear skins. They also
appear to have been cultivators of the soil
to some extent, even at this early date, and it
is recorded that Le Sueur made efforts to
have them locate near his Fort l&#8217;Huillier<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
as they were &#8220;industrious and accustomed to
cultivate the earth.&#8221; In addition to corn
they grew beans<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and Pike says &#8220;they cultivated
corn but not proportionately as much
as did the Sauks and Foxes.&#8221; This traveler
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>also states that they were less civilized than
the latter.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> At a much earlier date Father
Andr&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> writes that, while their village was a
large one they were poor as a tribe, their
greatest wealth being in &#8220;ox-hides<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and red
calumets,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> indicating thereby that the Iowa
early traded in and manufactured catlinite
pipes. In many customs prevailing among
the Iowa it has been found that they differed
but little from cognate tribes. In their visiting,
marriage relations, and management of
children they were not unlike the Omaha
and others closely allied among the Dakota.
In the matter of fraternity they were distinct.
The camp circle<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> was divided into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>half circles and occupied by two phratries of
four gentes each.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>The first regulated the hunt and other
affairs pertaining to the tribe during the autumn
and winter. Throughout the other
parts of the year the lead was taken by the
other phratry.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> In a general way however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>the Iowa social institution differs but slightly
from others of the Siouan stock, nor do
their visiting or marriage customs vary
greatly from those of kindred tribes. Children
are managed similarly to those of the
Dakota or Omaha. Formerly murder was
punished with death by the nearest of kin
or by some friend of the murdered person.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
Occasionally however, presents were made to
the avengers by the murderer, in consequence
of which the crime was palliated.</p>

<p>Like many other Mississippi Valley tribes
the Iowa are not to any great extent associated
with the tumuli of America. With the
exception of some few mounds in Wapello
County, Iowa, at a point near Iowaville, the
site of an early trading post, there is little
evidence that the Iowa were in any way connected
with the mounds in that State. Along
the valley located in this section, were many
spots frequented by both the Sauk and Fox as
well as Iowa and here also were situated the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>famous race tracks of nearly a mile in length,
belonging to the latter tribe.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The various
games indulged in by the Iowa differed but
slightly from those in vogue among kindred
or allied tribes.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> As is almost universal,
dice games, or games of chance are more generally
to be desired, while games of dexterity
take second place. Catlin<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> describes under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span>the former class, one called Kon-tho-gra, or
the game of platter which is played almost
exclusively by women.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> It is said to have
been exceedingly fascinating and consists of
little blocks of wood marked with certain
points for counting, to be decided by throws,
the lot being shaken in a bowl and thrown
out on a sort of a pillow. Bets were made
after the bowl was turned and decided by the
number of points and colors. Another game
described by Catlin<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> is called Ing-Kee-Ko-Kee,
or, The Game of the Moccasin. It was
played to a song accompaniment<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> among the
Iowa by two, four or six people seated on the
ground in a circle. In the center are three
or four moccasins, under one of which the
players in turn try to conceal some small article,
as a stone or a nut. The opponents
choose what appears to be the lucky covering
and if successful, win the stakes. The game,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">xxx</a></span>according to this writer, appeared simple and
almost foolish, yet he professes to have seen
it played for hours without intermission in
perfect musical rhythm, and states that it
&#8220;forms one of the principle gambling games
of these gambling people.&#8221; Among the
Omaha, Ponca, Oto, and Iowa the game of
Arrow (Ma<sup>n</sup>muqpe), was most common.
This however was more of a religious game
and now practically obsolete since the introduction
of fire arms. Arrows were shot up
into trees until they lodged in the branches.
The players then tried to dislodge them and
whoever brought down the first, won. There
were no sides or opposing parties. Probably
the most exciting and to many the most
important game among many of the tribes,
aside from those of the Mountain Indians, is
that of Ball-playing or Racket. This is distinctly
a man&#8217;s game as opposed to double-ball
and some other forms commonly played
by women. There are instances however of
this having been played by women, and
among the Santee Sioux it is at times played
by both sexes together. This game has been
divided into two principal classes, those of
the single and those of the double racket or
bat; the latter is more especially peculiar to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</a></span>
the southern tribes.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> The racket may be
likewise termed a throwing stick as it is used
to pick up and throw the ball rather than for
the purpose of hitting. The ball is either of
wood or of buckskin stuffed with hair,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and
the usual size is about two and one-half inches
in diameter. Various kinds of rackets
are used by the players, some preferring long
and some short handles. Among the Oto of
Oklahoma, one measured was forty inches in
length.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Catlin<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> gives an excellent description
of this game among the Iowa Indians.
His details concerning the goals and byes and
various points connected with the different
features, make this sketch one of the most
complete we have.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>As among all tribes east and west, north
and south, the Iowa were given to their nu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</a></span>merous
dances, many of which were of the
highest importance. Mention is made here,
only of several of the more common or necessary
dances, inasmuch as the subject is one
if it were treated fully would occupy a volume
in itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>The Welcome Dance</b></div>

<p>This is a peculiar dance given in honor of
one or more strangers
whom the tribe may decide
to welcome to their
village. The musicians as well as spectators,
out of respect, all rise to their feet while it
is being performed. The song which accompanies
it is at first one of lament, but ends in
a gay and lively manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>The War Dance</b></div>

<p>The most exciting as well as the longest
and most tiresome of all
dances. It is usually divided
into three parts, <i>i. e.</i>, Eh-Ros-Ka&#8212;The
Warriors Dance&#8212;usually given
after a party had returned from war as a
boast and was ofttimes given as an amusement.
The song used at this time entitled
Wa-Sissica&#8212;The War Song&#8212;appeared to
be addressed to the body of an enemy, from
the name Eh-Ros-Ka, meaning tribe, war
party or body.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Approaching Dance</b></div>

<p>The most spirited part of this greatest of
all dances was called the Approaching Dance
in which the dancers by
their gestures exhibited
the methods of advancing on an enemy. The
song in this portion is also similar to that
above mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>The Eagle Dance</b></div>

<p>Ha Kon-E-Crase, or as more familiarly
known &#8220;the soaring eagle,&#8221;
forms the third and most
pleasing part of the War
Dance and is in every respect a most interesting
spectacle. Each dancer imagines himself
a bird on the wing, and as they dance
forward from behind the musicians, they
take the position of an eagle headed against
the wind and about to swoop down upon some
unsuspecting prey. They have a peculiar
method of singing and whistling at the same
time.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>The Calumet Dance, the Ball-Play Dance,
the Scalp Dance, the Buffalo Dance, and the
Bear Dance, are all important but vary very
slightly from those of similar import among
other tribes of the same family. What we
have said about the dances applies with equal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</a></span>force to the songs and music. The War Song,
Death Song, Wolf Song, Medicine Song,
Bread Song, and Farewell Song are all of
much significance, indeed so much so that a
large amount of space could well be devoted
to this subject as well as to the dances.</p>

<p class="tb">In 1836 the Iowa were assigned a reservation
in northeastern Kansas, having two
years previous, ceded all their lands in Missouri.
A portion of the tribe later moved to
another tract in Oklahoma allotted to them
in 1890 in severalty, the surplus acreage being
opened to settlement by the whites.</p>

<p>It is difficult to compile a bibliography that
will treat exhaustively of this tribe. Catlin&#8217;s
Works, Lewis and Clark&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Travels</span>,
Long&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Expedition</span>, Pike&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Explorations</span>,
Maximilian&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Travels</span>, and in fact nearly all
of the prominent trans-continental explorers
knew the tribe under one or another name.
In the absence of any well defined plan it is
best to refer to the various titles as shown in
the index to the present volume. Such titles
are printed in small capitals throughout.
Special stress must be laid on the value of
Dr. Hayden&#8217;s important work, <span class="smcap">Contributions
to the Ethnography and Philology</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</a></span>

Phila., 1862. The map is particularly
useful. The Burrows Brothers monumental
reprint of the <span class="smcap">Jesuit Relations</span> (73 vols. octavo)
is of course invaluable.</p>

<h4>&#8220;IOWAY&#8221; TRIBE: (Aiyuw&aelig;, or P&auml;hu&#8217;tch&aelig;)</h4>

<p>This is the cognomen of a small tribe of
Indians, never very numerous,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> known to the
whites for the last one hundred and eighty

to the limits of the present State of Iowa,
which was therefore very properly named
after them.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> They are now located within
a Reservation of land on the west bank of

<h4>NOMENCLATURE</h4>

<p>The name by which we know them&#8212;that
of <span class="smcap">Ioway</span>&#8212;(or <span class="smcap">Iowa</span>, which is the form the
word takes when applied to the State)&#8212;is
not that for themselves, nor is it a name
which belongs to the language of any <i>one</i>
Indian tribe; but seems to have been made
up, or compounded, by the early French,
from the Dakota-Sioux designation for them
of Ayu&#8217;h&#8217;&auml;p&auml;, by taking the first two syllables,
Ayu&#8217;, and adding to it one of the common
Algonquin-French terminations to tribal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>names in <i>ois</i>, <i>vois</i>, or <i>vais</i> or <i>ouez</i>: all of
which terminations appear on the early records
compounded with Ayu, or a modification
of it, to indicate the Ioway Tribe. In
La Harpe&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> narrative of Le Sueur&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> mining
expedition, in 1700, to the Blue Earth
region, in now Minnesota, where the Ioways
are first of record referred to, they are written
of as &#8220;<span class="smcap">Aya-vois</span>&#8221;; in Pennecaud&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> rela<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>tion
of the same expedition they are the Aiaos
or Aiavos, (his MSS<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> in the Congressional
Library is obscure); in Charlevoix&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> history,
1722, he gives the name with a characteristic
effort at precision, as &#8220;<span class="smcap">Aiouez</span>&#8221;;
and in Lewis and Clark&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Travels</span>, 1812,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>they appear as &#8220;<span class="smcap">Ayauways</span>.&#8221; The French
first knew of the Ajow&aelig; through the Dakota-Sioux:
(as we will observe hereafter in the
gleanings of their early history,) and it is not
surprising to me that they should (or that
other Indian tribes should) seek to find some
easier way of distinguishing the Tribe than
to attempt to pronounce the extremely difficult
<i>guttural</i> ending of their Sioux designation.
<span class="smcap">The Dakota-Lexicon</span><a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> thus gives its
meaning:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ayu&#8217;hp&auml;, <i>n. p.</i> (<i>sleepy ones</i>:) the <i>Ioway
Indians</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The proper name which the Ioway give
themselves, acknowledging no other, is P&auml;hutch&#8217;&aelig;,
<i>Dusty-Heads</i>: sometimes translated,
but I think erroneously, <i>Dusty-Noses</i>.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> The
prefix <i>p&auml;</i> anciently signified <i>head</i>; and it
does yet in some cognate dialects and in combinations,
especially in old hereditary proper
names; though in modern parlance it is
generally confined to <i>nose</i>, but not invariably.</p>

<p>Inquiring into the origin of this name P&auml;hutch&#8217;&aelig;,
which, whether meaning <i>Dusty-Heads</i>
or <i>Dusty-Noses</i>, is quite a singular
one for a people to confer upon themselves,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="grammar" id="grammar"></a><img src="images/grammar.jpg" width="500" height="899"
alt="An Ioway Grammar" title="An Ioway Grammar" /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>I find recorded a <i>theory</i> to fit each translation.
In Schoolcraft&#8217;s official <span class="smcap">Collections</span>,
in a paper prepared February 1, 1848, by the
Ioway missionaries,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> page 262, volume III, I
read of the fanciful and somewhat strained
solution, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When they [the Ioway] separated from the first
Indian tribe, or family, to hunt game, their first location
was near the mouth of a river, where there were
large sand-bars, from which the wind blew quantities
of sand or dust upon their faces, from which they were
called Pa-hu-chas or Dusty-noses.</p></div>

<p><i>Per contra</i>: During November, 1873, when
I was at the former Winnebago Agency,
Blue Earth County, Minnesota, I mentioned
the above theory of the Ioway name to the
intelligent Winnebago ex-Chief &#8220;Baptiste,&#8221;
the Half-Breed, who in his youthful wanderings
had lived a considerable time on the
Missouri amongst the Ioway. He smiled at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>it, and, in his broken English at first and
then through ex-Interpreter Menaige, who
was present, said, that the Ioway name meant
<i>Dusty</i>, or Dusty Gray, <i>Heads</i>, and that it
occurred in this way: Living on the Missouri
as they had done in the earliest time:
wandering away from it and then wandering
back again; they were accustomed to bathe a
great deal in its yellow-muddy waters; and
that when they dried off after coming out of
the water, the sediment of the water remained
on their <i>heads</i> making them look <i>dusty</i> and
<i>gray</i>; and this was the true reason they became
the P&auml;hutch&#8217;&aelig;, or <i>Dusty-Head</i> Tribe.
Baptiste said this was the accepted theory
amongst the old people of the Ioway as to
the way P&auml;hutch&#8217;&aelig; came to be their name.
The Winnebago cognomen for them, which
is W&auml;h&#333;tch&#8217;&aelig;r&auml;, the <i>Gray-Ones</i>, is evidently
but a modification of the same <i>Dusty-Head</i>
idea: (in the H&#333;tchank&#8217;&aelig;r&auml; language h&#333;tch
is <i>gray</i> and r&auml;h&auml;tch, <i>ashes</i>). And such modification
is, also, I think the Dakota-Sioux
name for them of &Auml;yu&acute;h&#8217;&auml;p&auml;, notwithstanding
the Dakota-Sioux Lexicon gives it as
meaning the <i>Drowsy-Ones</i>, and to doubt such
authority may seem presumptuous. But, in
these investigations I have noticed, that ab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>original
nations, unless there is some special
reason to the contrary&#8212;for instance a special
enmity&#8212;(as the Chippeway name for the
Sioux of &#332;pwan&#8217;&auml;k, &#8220;those whom we roast,&#8221;)
all endeavor to <i>translate</i> into their own vernacular
the names of neighboring tribes,
rather than adopt them bodily: a notable instance
of which is, that the name <i>Saulteurs</i>,
people of the <i>Sault</i> or <i>Leap</i> or <i>Rapids</i>, is repeated
in idea but in different forms by both
the Winnebago and the Sioux, the latter
terming them H&auml;h&auml;&#8217;towa and the former
R&aelig;h&#8217;&auml;tch&#275;&#8217;r&auml;, both meaning, alike, &#8220;<i>The
Falls Dwellers</i>.&#8221; Sometimes, in these dialectical
translations, the original meaning of
the tribal name was correctly rendered, and
sometimes not: the early French in fact,
made frequent failures. Now, the Sioux
were well acquainted with the Ioway. They
were, at the advent of the whites, their allies
and neighbors, living as the Ioway did
in 1700, on the borders of Iowa and Minnesota,
about the headwaters of the Blue Earth
and Des Moines rivers:<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> though they soon
wandered from there to the Missouri again.
The Dakota must have known the name they
called themselves, and the reason for it: and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>what more likely than that they should endeavor
to render the idea it conveyed <i>literally</i>
into their own language? May not the
Sioux name for them, therefore, have been
originally &Auml;yu&#8217;h&#8217;&auml;p&auml;, deduced thus: &Auml; is the
preposition <i>on</i> or <i>upon</i>; yu &#8220;as a prefix to
<i>adjectives</i> and sometimes to nouns, it sometimes
forms verbs, and means to <i>make</i> or
<i>cause to be</i>&#8221; (Dakota-Lexicon); h&#8217;&auml;, is an
<i>adjective</i>, meaning, (says the Lexicon) &#8220;<i>gray</i>
or <i>mixed</i>, as black and white, the black appearing
under the white, as in the badger;&#8221;
and p&auml;, signifying <i>head</i>. This combination
would be literally, &#8220;upon&#8212;to cause&#8212;graymixed&#8212;the
head:&#8221; which is exactly the idea
that the Ioway themselves and the Winnebago
also seek to convey by their respective
names P&auml;hutch&#8217;&aelig;, the <i>Dusty-Heads</i>, and
W&auml;h&#333;tch&#8217;&aelig;r&auml;, the <i>Gray</i>, (through dust?)
People.</p>

<h4>EARLY HISTORY OF THE IOWAY</h4>

<p>The earliest mention<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> of the Tribe is in
Le Sueur&#8217;s narrative of his expedition in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
1700 to the fancied copper mines<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> of <i>Riviere</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
<i>de Vert</i>, (the Blue Earth tributary of the
Minnesota river), embodied in La Harpe&#8217;s
mss.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> <span class="smcap">History of Louisiana</span>, parts of which
including Le Sueur&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Narrative</span>, have been
recently published.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> As to this mine, we are
told in the mss. copy<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> in the Congressional
Library of the <span class="smcap">Relation of Penicaud</span>, the
shipwright who accompanied Le Sueur&#8212;&#8220;a
man, (says Neill,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> the erudite historian of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>Minnesota) of discernment but little scholarship&#8221;&#8212;that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>M. Le Sueur had heard of the mine some years
before while travelling in the country of the Aiaos&#8212;(or
Aivoe: the name has been written twice: and the
orthography is obscure,)&#8212;where he traded.</p></div>

<p>This acquaintance with the Ioway must
have been achieved when, as chief trader,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
he occupied the &#8220;factory&#8221; of &#8220;Fort Perrot&#8221;
on the &#8220;left&#8221; or east bank of the Mississippi,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
just below Point Le Sable, near the foot
of Lake Pepin: which first trading post of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>the upper Mississippi was erected in 1683, by
Nicholas Perrot<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> and M. le Sueur by order
of Governor De la Barre,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> of Canada, &#8220;to
establish (says the historian Neill) friendly
alliances with the Ioway and Dakota&#8221;; and
this post was for years the only one in all
that region, until Le Sueur himself, in 1695,
built the &#8220;French factory&#8221; of &#8220;Isle Pelee,&#8221;
at the &#8220;right&#8221; bank, on Prairie or &#8220;Bald&#8221;
Island, about ten miles below the St. Croix.
The Ioway, (as will hereafter appear), occupied
at that time a not very remote nor
inaccessible location from Fort Perrot, in
the region around and amidst the head waters
of the Des Moines and Blue Earth rivers,
and being allies of the Sioux, they doubtless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>brought their furs and obtained their trading
supplies of Le Sueur at this &#8220;Fort&#8221;: and
it is not improbable that Le Sueur (and his
engages) also travelled in their country on
hunting or trading expeditions.</p>

<p>In La Harpe&#8217;s account of Le Sueur&#8217;s long
&#8220;voyage&#8221; up the Mississippi from its mouth
to the &#8220;mine&#8221; with his &#8220;felucca,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> two canoes
and twenty men,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> the Ioway are frequently
mentioned. The first instance is when about
the 14th<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> of July, 1700, as he passed the
mouth of the Illinois, he &#8220;met three Canadian
voyageurs, who came to join his band,
and received by them a letter from Father
Marest,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> Jesuit, dated July 10, 1700, at the
Mission of the Immaculate Conception of the
Holy Virgin in Illinois:&#8221; of which the following
is a copy:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have the honor to write in order to inform you,
that the Saugiestas have been defeated by the Scioux
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
and the Ayavois.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> The people have formed an alliance
with the Quincapous, and some of the Mecoutins,
Renards, and Metesigamias, and gone to revenge themselves,
not on the Scioux, for they are too much afraid
of them, but perhaps on the Ayavois, or very likely
upon the Paoutees, or more probably upon the Osages,
for these suspect nothing, and the others are on their
guard. As you will probably meet these allied nations,
you ought to take precaution against their plans,
and not allow them to board your vessel, since they
are traitors, and utterly faithless. I pray God to accompany
you in all your designs.</p></div>

<p>This letter of Father Marest shows, that
the Ioway were then in alliance with the
Sioux, and establishes, that their Indo-<i>French</i>
name of &#8220;<i>Ayavois</i>&#8221; was already
pretty well understood: and that even their
own name for themselves was not unknown,
<span class="smcap">Paoutees</span>, or&#8212;(to transliterate the French
orthography into our Indian alphabet),&#8212;P&auml;ut&#8217;&aelig;s,
was not far off from their true designation
of P&auml;hutch&aelig;s: though, curiously
enough, they are held to be another tribe!
The warning of this war-party given Le
Sueur by the &#8220;Father&#8221; proved no false
alarm; for just below the Wisconsin, &#8220;five
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>Canadians&#8221; were met with, &#8220;descending
from the Scioux to go to Tamarois,&#8221; who,
above the Wisconsin, had been fallen in with
by a war-party of &#8220;ninety savages in nine
canoes,&#8221; being of &#8220;four different nations, the
<i>Outagamis</i> [Foxes], <i>Saquis</i> [Saukes], <i>Poutouwatamis</i>
and <i>Puans</i> [Winnebago], who
had &#8220;robbed and cruelly beat them.&#8221; Taking
these five men with him as volunteers,
Le Sueur proceeded up the river until he
met this war-party near Black River, returning
from an unsuccessful encounter with
the &#8220;<i>Scioux</i>,&#8221; and brought them to terms,
and, being evidently too strong for them to
maltreat or meddle with in any way, extorted
a kind of apology from them for what they
had done.</p>

<p>On the first of October Le Sueur finally
reached his destination near his &#8220;<i>mine</i>.&#8221;
We extract from the narrative of his proceeding
while here so much of it as refers
to the Ioway:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After he [Le Sueur] entered into <span class="smcap">Blue</span> river, thus
named on account of the <span class="smcap">MINES</span> of blue earth found at
its mouth, he founded his post, situated in 44 degrees
13 minutes north latitude. He met at this place nine
Scioux, who told him the river belonged to the Scioux
of the <span class="smcap">West</span>, the <span class="smcap">Ayavois</span> [Ioways], and Otoctatas
[Otoes], who lived a little farther off: that it was not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>their [the &#8220;Scioux&#8221;] custom to hunt on ground belonging
to others, unless invited to do so by the owners,
and that when they would come to the fort to obtain
provisions they would be in danger of being killed in
ascending or descending the rivers, which were narrow,
and that if he would show them pity, he must establish
himself on the Mississippi, near the mouth
of the St. Pierre, where the <span class="smcap">Ayavois</span>, the <span class="smcap">Otoctatas</span>,
and the other <span class="smcap">Scioux</span>, could go as well as them....
Le Sueur had forseen that the establishment
of <span class="smcap">Blue</span> river would not please the <span class="smcap">Scioux</span>,
... because they were the first with whom trade
was commenced, and in consequence of which they
had already quite a number of guns.... On the
3d of October, they received at the fort several
<span class="smcap">Scioux</span>, among whom was <span class="smcap">Wahkantape</span>, chief of the
village. Soon two Canadians arrived who had been
hunting, and had been robbed by the <span class="smcap">Scioux</span> of
the east, who had raised their guns against the
establishment which <span class="smcap">M. Le Sueur</span> had made on Blue
river. On the 14th the fort was finished and
named &#8220;Fort L&#8217;Huillier,&#8221; and on the 22d two Canadians
were sent out to invite the Ayavois and Otoctatas
to come and establish a village near the fort, because
these Indians are industrious [?] and accustomed to
cultivate the earth, [?] and they hoped to get provisions
from them and to make them work [!] in the
mines.</p></div>

<p>An assertion, a hope and an expectation
which rather proves, that Le Sueur knew
nothing of these Indians from actual observation
in their country, but only knew of
them from report and by a few individuals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
whom he probably met for trade at the posts
at Forts <i>Perrot</i> or <i>Isle Pele</i>; for there is no
evidence that they ever were &#8220;industrious,&#8221;
or given to &#8220;cultivating the earth&#8221; any more
than other Indians: nor are they at this day.
But, to continue our extracts:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The same day [the 24th] the Canadians, who had
been sent off on the 22d arrived without having found
the road which led to the Ayavois and Otoctates.</p>

<p>... On the 16th [of Nov.] the Scioux returned
to their village, and it was reported that the Ayavois
and Otoctatas were going to establish themselves towards
the Missouri river, near the Maha [Omahaw],
who dwell in that region.</p></div>

<p>In May, 1701, Le Sueur left Fort d&#8217;Huillier
in charge of M. d&#8217;Evaque, a Canadian
gentleman, with a force of twelve Frenchmen,
while he himself in his felucca with the
rest of his men returned to Mobile, carrying
with him &#8220;three canoe loads,&#8221; or &#8220;four thousand
pounds,&#8221; of the &#8220;green earth,&#8221; supposed
to be oxide of copper, but which was
really from a kind of shelly marly strata, interposed
between the fossiliferous limestone
and the sandstone of that region, that was
colored bluish-green by silicate of iron. We
next find Le Sueur&#8212;(who it has been stated
was the father of the three distinguished
brothers D&#8217;Iberville, DeBienville, and Sau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>volle)<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>&#8212;in
the summer of 1701 accompanying
D&#8217;Iberville, the Governor of Louisiana,
on his return to France, and assisting him
while on shipboard in concocting a Memorial
on the Mississippi Valley, addressed to the
French government: in which D&#8217;Iberville
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He [<span class="smcap">M. Le Sueur</span>] has spoken to me of another,
[nation] which he calls the Mahas, [Omahaw], composed
of more than twelve hundred families [!], the
Ayooues and the Octootatas, their neighbors, are about
three hundred families. They occupy the lands between
the Mississippi and the Missouri, about one
hundred leagues from the Illinois. These savages do
not know the use of (fire?) arms....</p></div>

<p>The memorial, (a manuscript copy of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>which, quoted by Professor Neill in his Minnesota
history, is in possession of the Historical
Society of that State), contains the first
<i>attempt</i> we have upon the record at a <i>Census</i>
of the Tribes of the Mississippi, and partially
of the Missouri Valleys: made thirty-four
years before the French Census of the Cass
manuscript<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>&#8212;a census formerly claimed
as being the very first extant&#8212;so claimed by
Schoolcraft, in the third volume of his <span class="smcap">Collections</span>.</p>

<p>Penicaud, the carpenter, states, that
D&#8217;Evaque and the men Le Sueur left in
charge of the Blue Earth post, abandoned
it, and returned to Mobile [arriving there
on the 3d of March], 1703, having left, as
they alleged, on account of being warred upon
&#8220;by the nations of Maskoutens and Foxes,&#8221;
and &#8220;seeing that he was out of powder
and lead.&#8221; Le Sueur for several years after
his operations on the Blue-Earth was kept
busy leading expeditions against the Natchez
and other Indians of the southwest; and is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>said to have died<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> on the road during one
of them.</p>

<p>Some further information in regard to the
Ioway is gathered from a chart of the northwestern
part of Louisiana, by &#8220;<span class="smcap">William De
L&#8217;Isle</span>, <i>de l&#8217;Academy Royale des Sciences,
et Premier Geographe du Roy: a Paris</i>:
1703&#8221; in the preparation of which Le Sueur
probably assisted by his notes and observations.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
A section of this map, (lithograph<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>ed
for Neill&#8217;s History of Minnesota), shows
a traders trail marked &#8220;<i>Chemin des Voyageurs</i>,&#8221;
across the State of Iowa, commencing
at the Mississippi, a few miles below the
mouth of the Wisconsin, and following west
by a little north until in the vicinity of Spirit
Lake, it struck just below the lowest of the
lakes which are at the head of the Little
Sioux river, upon which lower lake is marked
&#8220;Village des Aiaoues <i>ou</i> Paoutez&#8221; (P&auml;hutch&#8217;&aelig;);
then continuing due westward towards
the Big Sioux this <i>Chemin du Voyageurs</i>
bends a little southward towards the
mouth of that river; on which river, near
the Missouri, three or four villages of &#8220;<i>Maha</i>&#8221;
(Omahaw), are marked. Besides these
a couple of minor &#8220;<i>Aianouez</i>&#8221; villages are
likewise set down at the west end of the <i>Che<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>min
des Voyageurs</i> where it strikes the Big
Sioux, which is apparently about the junction
of &#8220;Fish Creek&#8221; with it: [See Waw-non-que-skoon-a&#8217;s
map of Ioway migrations
in Vol. III, Schoolcraft, page 256],<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> and
again further westward, considerably beyond
the western termination of the &#8220;<i>Chemin</i>&#8221;
on the James River, four minor villages
of &#8220;<i>Aiaouez</i>&#8221; are also noted: while far
south by a little east of the first mentioned
main &#8220;Village des Aiaoues <i>ou Paoutez</i>,&#8221; upon
the north or &#8220;left&#8221; bank of the Missouri
river at a point nearly due west from the
mouth of the &#8220;<i>Des Moines ou le Moingona</i>,&#8221;
we find located the &#8220;Yoways,&#8221; and a few
miles above them on the same side, the &#8220;Les
Octotata&#8221;: which locations were not a great
distance from the spot where the Ioway and
Otoe now live upon one common &#8220;Reservation,&#8221;
on the opposite side of the Missouri
just within Nebraska.</p>

<h4>ANTE-WHITE HISTORY OF THE IOWAY</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="map" id="map"></a><a href="images/mapzoom.jpg"><img src="images/map.jpg" width="500" height="377"
alt="MAP of the COUNTRY formerly occupied by the IOWAY TRIBE of INDIANS" title="" /></a></div>

<p>For the history of the Ioway before the
whites knew them, there is no data, beyond
language and ancestral beliefs and customs,
except their own vague traditions or those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>equally vague and uncertain of other tribes.
The Reverends William Hamilton, and S. M.
Irvin, their missionaries, communicated to
Schoolcraft<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> in 1848, this statement of &#8220;an
old Ioway Indian [aged] about sixty years
or more.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>About sixty-six years ago, we lived on a river, which
runs from a lake to the Mississippi, from the east,
and on the east side of that river. Our fathers and
great fathers lived there for a long time, as long as
they could recollect. At that time we had about four
hundred men fit to go to war, but we were then small
to what we had been. Our fathers say, as long as
they can recollect, we have been diminishing. (This
is a usual Indian complaint: in most instances an unfounded
one). We owned all the land east of the
Mississippi. (This usual Indian claim of very extended
possessions has generally very little foundation
in fact). Whatever ground we made tracks through,
it was ours. Our fathers saw white men on the
[great?] lakes about 120 years ago; [Nearer 200
probably]; do not know where they came from. About
the same time we first got guns. We were afraid of
them at first, they seemed like the &#8220;Great Spirit.&#8221;
Our fathers also, at the same time, for the first received
iron, axes, hoes, kettles and woollen blankets.
We, the [present] old men of our nation, first saw
white men between forty and fifty years ago, near the
mouth of the Missouri.</p></div>

<p>The same missionary gentlemen, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>same paper, make these observations, which
every one who has ever engaged in Indian
researches, or in inquiries of the Indians
themselves, will endorse as entirely correct:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In tracing their history, religion, &amp;c., it will be exceedingly
difficult to proceed with certainty and satisfaction,
from the differences we find in the notions
of different individuals: <i>e. g.</i> today we will sit down
with an old Indian, who will enter into a plausible
detail of their history, or religious belief, or some
traditions of their fathers. Another of the same age
and patriarchal rights will give quite a different statement
about the same things; or perhaps the same individual
would tomorrow give his own story quite a
different shade. This is the reason why the reports
of the transient observers vary so much. It requires
long acquaintance, and close observation, to arrive at
anything like just conclusions on these points; and
it is only by collecting different and conflicting notions,
and balancing them, that we can find which prevails.</p></div>

<p>Now, in regard to the story of the &#8220;old
Ioway Indian&#8221; above quoted, it may be remarked
that it is quite certain the Ioway
Tribe did not &#8220;about sixty years&#8221; previous
to 1848, that is, in 1788, live anywhere on
the east side of the Mississippi, nor had they
for more than a hundred years before 1848,
and it is doubtful if they had ever done so
since the advent of the whites upon the great
lakes. But though documents extant nega<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>tive
this story of the &#8220;old Ioway Indian&#8221;
as to <i>time</i>, may there not be in this statement
the shadowy tribal recollection of the period
when they were a Band of the H&#333;tchank&aelig;r&auml;
or Winnebago, and lived near them? This
lake and river &#8220;east of the Mississippi,&#8221;
their former residence, may have been <i>Mille
Lacs</i> and its outlet in Minnesota, subsequently
the home of the Sioux when first visited by
De Groseilliers and Raddison,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> and then by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
DuLuth<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> and Hennepin? or the Chippeway
River? or the Wisconsin? or <i>Rock River</i>?
Traditions of the Santee [Esany&auml;t&#275;] Sioux
who up to 1852 occupied the upper Mississippi
in Minnesota allege that when they emigrated
from the North the Ioway were in
possession of the region around the mouth
of the Minnesota river, and that they drove
them away. On this head, two of their reliable
missionaries, Reverends Dr. Williamson
and G. H. Pond, have communicated articles
to the Minnesota Historical Collections.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Pond writes, in the number for 1852,
pages 23 and 24, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Takoha, the old war prophet, says that the Iowa
Indian never occupied the country around the mouth
of the Minnesota river. He affirms that it once belonged
to the Winnebagoes who were long ago driven
from it by the Dakotas&#8212;a few others of the Dakotas
agree with Takoha. But Black Tomahawk, who is by
some of the most intelligent half-breeds considered the
best Mdewakantonwan traditionist, says that in the
earliest years of the existence of the Dakotas they
became acquainted with the Iowa Indians, and that
they lived in a village at the place which is now called
Oak Grove, seven or eight miles from Fort Snelling,
on the north side of the Minnesota river. The numerous
little mounds which are to be seen about Oak
Grove, he says, are the works of the Iowa Indians.</p>

<p>The old man says that in ancient times, when the
Dakotas had no arms but the bow and stone or horn
headed arrows, and used knives and axes manufactured
from the same materials, these little mounds
which we now see at the place above named were the
dwellings of the Iowas. They were the enemies of the
Dakotas, who used occasionally to make a warpath
from Mille Lac, where they then resided, down to the
Iowa village, and carry off with them scalps, which
made glad the hearts of their wives and daughters.
The strife between the two nations eventually became
desperate, and the gods, who are always deeply interested
in Indian wars, espoused the cause of the Dakotas.</p>

<p>The thunder, which the Dakotas believe to be a
winged monster, and which in character seems to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>answer very well to the Mars of the ancient heathen,
bore down upon the Iowa village in a most terrible
and god-like manner. Tempests howled, the forked
lightnings flashed, and the thunders uttered their
voices; the earth trembled; a thunderbolt was hurled
at the devoted village, which ploughed the earth, and
formed that deep ravine near the present dwelling of
Peter Quinn. This occurrence unnerved the Iowas,
and the Dakotas, taking advantage of it, fell upon
their enemies and drove them across the Minnesota
river and burned up their village.</p>

<p>The Iowas then built another village on the south
side of the river near the present planting grounds
of Grey Iron, where they remained till the Dakotas
obtained firearms, when they fought their last battle
with them in Minnesota, on Pilot Knob, back of Mendota.
The Iowas who escaped on this occasion fled
and erected their next village at the mouth of the
Iowa river, from which they were again eventually
driven by the Dakotas towards the Missouri. The old
man from whom we gather the substance of what has
gone before says that these mounds are the remains of
the dwelling houses of the ancient Iowas. Some say
that they are not the remains of the dwellings of the
Iowas, but those of some other people with whom
tradition does not acquaint them; and others still say
that they are ancient burial places.</p>

<p>The following two or three facts may not be without
interest to the reader. Some six years since, Mr.
Quinn of Oak Grove removed the earth of one of these
mounds at the same place where Black Tomahawk says
the ancient Iowa village stood. As the earth was
removed on a level with the natural surrounding surface,
charred poles and human bones were found.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
It was easy and natural for the imagination to supply
the rest, and make the fact corroborate the tradition
of the old man, when he says that the Iowas constructed
their houses by leaning poles together at the
top and spreading them at the foot, forming a circular
frame, which they covered with earth. In one of these
houses a man or woman had been killed, and the timbers
of the house fired, which, of course, would let
the earth fall in upon the dead body and burning
poles.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Williamson, on page 10 to 12, of the
Minnesota Historical Collections of 1856,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We think it is sufficiently manifest that the Sioux
occupied the better part of Minnesota when Europeans
entered it, a little after the middle of the seventeenth
century. It does not, however, appear that they were
the first, much less the only inhabitants of the country.
Their common and most reliable traditions inform us,
that when their ancestors first came to the Falls of St.
Anthony, the Iowas&#8212;whom they call <span class="smcap">Ayuhba</span>
[Drowsy]&#8212;occupied the country about the mouth
of the Minnesota river, and the Shiens, called by the
Dakotas <span class="smcap">Sha-i-ena</span>, sometimes written by the French
Chaienne, and by others Shiene, dwelt higher up on
the same river. We cannot pretend to determine with
certainty at what time the Sioux first came to the
Falls of St. Anthony; but may say, with confidence, it
was a long time ago, probably before the discovery of
America by Columbus. One of the best informed men
concerning their traditions that I have met with among
the Dakotas, who has been dead more than ten years,
when questioned on this point, told me, that they sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>posed
it to be at least equal to the lifetime of four old
men, who should live one after the other; and as an
example of an old man, named his father, who, I suppose,
was at the time at least eighty years old, [which
would make the time three hundred years.]</p>

<p>The Winnebagoes, Otoes, and Omahas, have been
named among the nations driven by the ancestors of
the Dakotas from the Minnesota valley. I have not
found any evidence, satisfactory to my mind, that the
Winnebagoes ever had a home in this Territory prior
to their late removal into it by the United States government.
As respects the Otoes and Omahas it seems
not improbable that they were reckoned as a part of
the Dakota nation, when the Sioux first hunted on the
banks of the Mississippi, and for some time after. The
Anthontantas, mentioned as a part of the Nadouesiouz,
by Hennepin, were probably the same people as the
Otoctatas, mentioned in connection with the Ayavois,
as owners of the country about Blue Earth river, in
the fragment of Le Sueur, preserved by La Harpe, and
again some further on, as having recently left their
village in that neighborhood, and settled near the
Mahas on the Missouri river, and it is highly probable
that the Otoctatas of Le Sueur are the same people
now called Ottoes or Otoes. The Mawhaws, Shiens
and Schiannesse, are mentioned by Carver, as bands
of the Naudowessiex of the plains. Thus it appears
that the Shiens, the Iowas, the Omahas and the Ottoes,
were the earliest inhabitants of Minnesota of whom we
have any written or certain traditional account. I
have neither seen nor heard of any artificial mounds,
ancient fortifications, or monuments of any kind in or
near the Minnesota valley, which might not have been
constructed by these Indians. Such mounds are prob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>ably
as numerous in the lower part of the valley of
the Minnesota, and the contiguous part of the Mississippi,
as anywhere else between the Alleghany and
Rocky Mountains; but they are very small, compared
with those near the Ohio, not to speak of those farther
south. Some of them are still used by the Dakotas,
as burying places for their dead, and in this way are
receiving a small increase almost every year. The
situation of many others indicates that they had a
similar origin.</p>

<p>But by far the most numerous class appear from
their size and situation, to be what Dakota tradition
says they are, the remains of houses, made of poles
and bark, covered with earth, such as were a few years
since, and probably still are, the habitations of the
Mandans, and some other tribes living on the Missouri....
Mounds of this class are found in clusters,
of from less than half a dozen to upwards of fifty,
arranged irregularly as we find the bark houses of
the Indians at present. Their base usually approaches
to an oval form. Their length is from ten to forty
feet, and a few exceed this, with a height of from
one or two feet, to three or four. Very few of this
class exceed four feet; though some of those used for
places of sepulture are more than twice that height.
Back of them we find the land level, or nearly so, dry
and fertile. In front it descends towards some water,
and almost always there is a lake or morass in sight,
indicating that the inhabitants depended for a subsistence
partly on cultivating the earth, and partly on
water fowl or roots, which they obtained from wet
swampy land. Several clusters of such mounds may
be seen about Oak Grove, where the Dakotas say the
Iowas lived, when their ancestors first came to this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>country. The path from Mendota to Shakopee, or
Prairieville, passes through several. One large one,
a little south of what has been called Black Dog&#8217;s or
Grey Iron&#8217;s village, where the <span class="smcap">Iowas</span> are said to have
resided after they were driven from Oak Grove. Another
is not far from the tamarack swamp below
Shakopee. Many may be found on the bluffs of the
Mississippi and Lake Pepin. Such mounds are very
numerous in the prairie near the mouth of Cannon
river.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that the Iowas, whose
language shows that they are descended from the same
stock as the Dakotas, should have been viewed and
treated by the Dakotas as enemies. While the <span class="smcap">Shiens</span>,
who Gallatin says have a language kindred to the
Algonquin, were received as allies, and though speaking
a different language were long, if they are not still
counted as a part of the Dakota nation. Hence their
name, Sha-i-e-na in the Ihanktonwan dialect, being
equivalent to Sha-i-api in the Isanyati [missionary
special alphabet spelling]<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> both applied to those who
speak a different language from the Dakotas, and
applied especially to Shiens, because all others speaking
a different language were counted as enemies. It
is also worthy of remark, that notwithstanding the
hostility between the Iowas and Sioux, the former,
who are called by the latter Ayukba, (they sleep, or
&#8220;sleepy ones&#8221;), from which we probably got Iowa,
remain much nearer their original location than the
Shiens, or any of the other tribes, who dwelt in the
Minnesota valley before the Dakotas.</p>

<p>When the Dakotas first came in contact with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>Shiens, I have not been able to learn, farther than that
the Shiens formerly planted on the Minnesota, between
Blue Earth and Lac-qui-Parle, whence they moved
to a western branch of Red River of the North, which
still bears their name; being called by the Dakotas who
hunt in that region, Shai-e-na-wojupi, (&#8220;the place
where those of another language plant&#8221;). The various
spellings of this name, all show plainly their origin
from the Dakota name. From this planting place on
the Chaienne, or Shienne of the North, this people
removed across the Missouri, where they gave their
name to another river; and having ceased to cultivate
the soil, it is said they now hunt on the head waters
of the Platte and of the Arkansas. From their retiring
so rapidly, it is probable that the Shiens had not
occupied the Minnesota valley long before the arrival
of the Dakotas, and that the first inhabitants of it, if
not the Iowas, were Otoes, Omahas, or some other
family of the Dakota stock. The languages of the
tribes just named, as well as of the Winnebagoes and
Osages, are so similar to the Dakota, as to indicate a
common origin. In the languages of the Mandans,
Minetares and Crows or Upsarakas, so many Dakota
words have been found, as to render it highly probable,
that they also, in part at least, belong to the
same stock....</p>

<p>Various circumstances, ... indicate that the
Sioux resided long in the region where Hennepin found
them. Many of them suppose that they originated
there. They [the modern Sioux],<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> have a tradition,
however, that their ancestors came thither from the
Northeast, where they had resided on a lake. It has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>been generally supposed, that the lake referred to in
this tradition, is Rainy lake, or Lake of the Woods.
It is more probable, however, that it was the northern
shore of Lake Superior, or Hudson&#8217;s Bay, or some of
the lakes between those large expanses of water. The
Ojibwas have a tradition, that their ancestors drove
the Sioux from the shores of Lake Superior.</p></div>

<p>In Schoolcraft&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Collections</span>, Volume
III, page 256, there is presented a map
drawn by the Ioway Missionaries, the Reverends
Hamilton and Irvin, from the rough
draft of &#8220;<span class="smcap">Waw-non-que-skoon-a</span>,&#8221; an
Ioway brave, showing the successive migrations
of the tribe: their starting point being
given from the mouth of Rock River in Illinois:
which last named river, it may be observed,
answers exactly the description of
the one on which was the ancient or first residence
of the Tribe mentioned in the tradition
before given as being &#8220;a river which runs
from a lake to the Mississippi from the east,
and on the east side of that river:&#8221; Rock river
heading as is well known in the &#8220;Four
Lakes&#8221; upon the banks of one of which Madison,
the capital of Wisconsin, is built, and
also in another, Lake Koshkonong; which
lakes, however, did not become the seat of the
Winnebago until long after they were known
to the whites. The letter-press description<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
of this map of the &#8220;Migrations of the
Ioway,&#8221; Vol. III, at page 257, of Schoolcraft,
we here copy, with additional explanations,
inserted in brackets:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The object of Waw-non-que-skoon-a was to denote
the places where the Iowas had lived during the sixteen
migrations which preceded their residence at their
present location, the Missouri; and, in truth, it nearly
exhausts their history. The marks to denote a fixed
residence, are a symbol for a lodge. These are carefully
preserved, with their exact relative position.
Their order, as given, is also preserved by figures.
Could eras be affixed to these residences, it would give
entire accuracy to the modern part of their history.</p>

<p>As it is, it depicts some curious facts in the history
of predatory and erratic tribes, showing how they
sometimes crossed their own track, and demonstrates
the immense distances to which they rove.</p>

<p>The earliest date to which their recollection extends,
as indicated by location No. 1, is at [or near] the
junction of Rock river with the Mississippi. This was,
manifestly, in or very near Winnebago territory, and
confirms the traditions of several of the Missouri
tribes (vide Fletcher&#8217;s paper), [and also of the Ioway
Indian aged &#8220;sixty years or more&#8221;]. From this
point they migrated down the Mississippi to the river
Des Moines, and fixed themselves at No. 2, on its south
fork. [eighty miles above the mouth]. They next
made an extraordinary migration, abandoning the Mississippi
and all its upper tributaries, and ascending
the Missouri to a point of land formed by a small
stream, on its east shore, called by the Indians Fish
creek, which flows in from the direction of, and not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>far from, the celebrated Red Pipe stone quarry, on
the heights of the Coteau des Prairies. No. 3.</p>

<p>They next descended the Missouri to the junction of
the Nebraska, or Great Platte river, with that stream.
No. 4. They settled on the west [or right] bank, keeping
the buffalo ranges on their west. They next migrated
still lower down the Missouri, and [crossing
to its left side], fixed themselves on the headwaters
of the Little Platte river. [not far from Fort Leavenworth],
No. 5.</p>

<p>From this location, when circumstances had rendered
another change desirable, they returned to the
Mississippi, and located themselves at the mouth of
Salt river. No. 6. Here passed another period. They
next ascended the Mississippi, and settled on its
[&#8220;left&#8221;] east bank, at the junction of a stream in the
present area of Illinois. [about midway between the
Des Moines and the Ioway]. No. 7. Their next migration
carried them still higher on that shore, [nearer
the mouth of the Ioway] to the junction of another
stream, No. 8, which is well nigh&#8212;[within fifty or
sixty miles], to their original starting point at No. 1.</p>

<p>They receded again to the south and west, first fixing
themselves on Salt river, No. 9, above their prior site,
No. 6, and afterwards changing their location to its
very source. [about thirty miles higher]. No. 10.
They then passed, evidently by land, [about sixty
miles due west], to the higher forks of the river Chariton,
of Missouri, No. 11, and next descended that
stream to near its mouth. No. 12. The next two migrations
of this tribe were [about thirty miles] to the
west valley of the Grand river, and then to its forks.
[twenty-five miles from them]. No. 14. Still continuing
their general migrations to the south and west,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>they chose the east bank of the Missouri, opposite the
present site of Fort Leavenworth, No. 15, and finally
settled on the west bank of the Missouri, [on their
Reservation] between the mouth of the Wolf and
Great Namahaw, No. 16, where they now reside.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>These migrations are deemed to be all of quite modern
date, not excepting the probable period to which
well-known tradition could reach. They do not, it
would seem, aspire to the area of their ancient residence
on the lower and upper Iowa rivers, and about
the region of St. Anthony&#8217;s falls.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>We are taught something by these migrations. They
were probably determined by the facility of procuring
food. They relied, ever, greatly on the deer, elk, and
buffalo. As these species are subject to changes, it is
probable they carried the Indians with them.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> It is
not probable that their locations were of long continuance
at a place. Not over a dozen years at a location,
on the average. It might be longer at some places,
and less at others. This would not give a period of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>more than 180 years, before their arrival at their present
place....<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>It is not probable that the game-pursuing Indians
were more fixed in their ancient, than in their modern
locations. Indeed, the very reverse is true; for the
modern hunter tribes avail themselves of the proximity
of military posts, and out-settlements, to guard
themselves from the approaches of hostile bands.</p>

<p>The population of the Iowas, as given at early dates,
is very uniform, having evidently been copied by one
writer from another. In some ancient MS. data in the
Royal Marine Office, at Paris, which were submitted
to the inspection of the American Minister (General
Cass) in 1842, their numbers were put down, for about
1730, at 1100. When Colonel Bouquet marched over
the Alleghanies against the western Indians, in 1764,
the same numbers were used. Each of these dates
assigns their residence to the Missouri, and there had,
evidently, no recent information been received. The
French alone were at that time in communication with
them, and their alliance with the western Indians, in
this war, made it impracticable to obtain further data.</p></div>

<p>By the official returns made to the Indian
Bureau, in 1848, they are stated at &#8220;a fraction
under seven hundred and fifty souls,&#8221;
but in Sub-Agent Vaughan&#8217;s report in the
fall of the same year, 669 is the enumeration.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>
In the report of 1844 their census is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>stated at 470. In 1701,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> D&#8217;Iberville&#8217;s memorial<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
to France says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>the Ayooues and the Octootatas, their neighbors, are
about 300 families. [In M. Chauvignerie&#8217;s Report<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>of the Census of tribes, made to the French government
in 1736, the &#8220;Ayouas&#8221; are put down at 80 warriors].</p></div>

<p>In the report of the Indian Bureau for
1874, the Ioway and Otoe together, including
some Sauk and some Missourie, numbered
864 persons.</p>

<p>It is recorded, that there were ten Ioway
&#8220;Ayeouais&#8221;) with Montcalm and the
French Army at the seige of Ticonderoga
in July, 1757, and also 48 Winnebago (&#8220;Puants&#8221;)&#8212;De
Tailly being their joint Interpreter.</p>

<p>According to Lieutenant Zebulon M. Pike&#8217;s
report of 1806,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> the &#8220;Aiowais&#8221; were called
by the French, colloquially, &#8220;<i>Ne Perce</i>&#8221;;
which was probably &#8220;<i>Nez Perce</i>,&#8221; Pierced
or Perforated Noses:<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> the first syllable of
P&auml;hutch&aelig;, their own tribal name, being
translated <i>nose</i>, which in some word-relations
would be correct; while probably the
last two syllables&#8212;ru&#8217;tch&aelig;&#8212;were deemed
to be in the sense of K&#275;ru&#8217;tch&aelig;, a word signifying
to <i>divide</i> or <i>part</i>. This was a near
enough translation for the early French
traders, who were not particular.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX A</h3>

<h4>THE IOWA CAMPING CIRCLE</h4>

<p>The camping circle among the Iowa was usually
divided into two half circles, each occupied by two
phratries of four gentes each. These regulated the
hunt and numerous other tribal affairs during the four
seasons, the first phratry taking the lead during Autumn
and Winter; the second during Spring and Summer.</p>

<p>The list which follows was prepared in part by Rev.
William Hamilton about 1880 and before his death
communicated to the late J. O. Dorsey, who added a
considerable number of gentes and subgentes, some
further assistance being obtained through the aid of a
delegation of Iowa while on a visit to Washington.</p>

<h4>TREATY WITH THE SIOUX, ETC., AUG. 19, 1825</h4>

<p class="indent"><i>Treaty with the Sioux and Chippewa, Sacs and Fox,
Menominie, Ioway, Sioux, Winnebago, and a portion
of the Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawattomie, Tribes.</i></p>

<p>The United States of America have seen with much
regret, that wars have for many years been carried on
between the Sioux and the Chippewas, and more recently
between the confederated tribes of Sacs and
Foxes, and the Sioux; and also between the Ioways
and Sioux; which, if not terminated, may extend to
the other tribes, and involve the Indians upon the
Missouri, the Mississippi, and the Lakes, in general
hostilities. In order, therefore, to promote peace
among these tribes, and to establish boundaries among
them and the other tribes who live in their vicinity,
and thereby to remove all causes of future difficulty,
the United States have invited the Chippewa, Sac,
and Fox, Menominie, Ioway, Sioux, Winnebago, and
a portion of the Ottowa, Chippewa, and Potawatomie
Tribes of Indians living upon the Illinois, to assemble
together, and in a spirit of mutual conciliation to accomplish
these objects; and to aid therein, have appointed
William Clark and Lewis Cass, Commissioners
on their part, who have met the Chiefs, Warriors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
and Representatives of the said tribes, and portions
of tribes, at Prairie des Chiens, in the Territory of
Michigan, and after full deliberation, the said tribes,
and portions of tribes, have agreed with the United
States, and with one another, upon the following articles:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article I</span></h4>

<p>There shall be a firm and perpetual peace between
the Sioux and Chippewas; between the Sioux and the
confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes; and between
the Ioways and the Sioux.</p>

<p class="gesperrt">&nbsp;***</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article III</span></h4>

<p>The Ioways accede to the arrangement between the
Sacs and Foxes, and the Sioux; but it is agreed between
the Ioways and the confederated tribes of the
Sacs and Foxes, that the Ioways have a just claim to
a portion of the country between the boundary line
described in the next preceding article, and the Missouri
and Mississippi; and that the said Ioways, and
Sacs and Foxes, shall peaceably occupy the same, until
some satisfactory arrangement can be made between
them for a division of their respective claims
to country.</p>

<p class="gesperrt">&nbsp;***</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XI</span></h4>

<p>The United States agree, whenever the President
may think it necessary and proper, to convene such
of the tribes, either separately or together, as are interested
in the lines left unsettled herein, and to recommend
to them an amicable and final adjustment of
their respective claims, so that the work, now hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>pily
begun, may be consummated. It is agreed, however,
that a Council shall be held with the Yancton
band of the Sioux, during the year 1826, to explain
to them the stipulations of this treaty, and to procure
their assent thereto, should they be disposed to give it,
and also with the Ottoes, to settle and adjust their
title to any of the country claimed by the Sacs, Foxes,
and Ioways.</p>

<p class="gesperrt">&nbsp;***</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XIII</span></h4>

<p>It is understood by all the tribes, parties hereto, that
no tribe shall hunt within the acknowledged limits of
any other without their assent, but it being the sole
object of this arrangement to perpetuate a peace
among them, and amicable relations being now restored,
the Chiefs of all the tribes have expressed a
determination, cheerfully to allow a reciprocal right
of hunting on the lands of one another, permission
being first asked and obtained, as before provided for.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XIV</span></h4>

<p>Should any causes of difficulty hereafter unhappily
arise between any of the tribes, parties hereunto, it
is agreed that the other tribes shall interpose their
good offices to remove such difficulties; and also that
the government of the United States may take such
measures as they may deem proper, to effect the same
object.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XV</span></h4>

<p>This treaty shall be obligatory on the tribes, parties
hereto, from and after the date hereof, and on the
United States, from and after its ratification by the
government thereof.</p>

the half-breeds of said Tribes and Bands may be suffered

titles are held: but the President of the United States
may hereafter assign to any of the said half-breeds, to

<h4>TREATY WITH THE IOWA, ETC., SEPT. 17, 1836</h4>

<p class="indent"><i>Articles of a treaty, made and concluded at Fort Leavenworth,
on the Missouri river, between William
Clark, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, on the part
of the United States, of the one part, and the undersigned
chiefs, warriors, and counsellors of the
Ioway tribe and the band of Sacks and Foxes of the
Missouri, (residing west of the State of Missouri,)
in behalf of their respective tribes, of the other part.</i></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 1</span></h4>

<p>By the first article of the treaty of Prairie du Chien,
held the fifteenth day of July eighteen hundred and
thirty, with the confederated tribes of Sacks, Foxes,
Ioways, Omahaws, Missourias, Ottoes, and Sioux, the
country ceded to the United States by that treaty, is
to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the
President of the United States to the tribes living
thereon, or to such other tribes as the President may
locate thereon for hunting and other purposes.&#8212;And
whereas it is further represented to us the chiefs, warriors,
and counsellors of the Ioways and Sack and Fox
band aforesaid, to be desirable that the lands lying
between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river,
should be attached to and become a part of said State,
and the Indian title thereto, be entirely extinguished;
but that, notwithstanding, as these lands compose a
part of the country embraced by the provisions of said
first article of the treaty aforesaid, the stipulations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
thereof will be strictly observed until the assent of the
Indians interested is given to the proposed measures.</p>

<p>Now we the chiefs, warriors, and counsellors of the
Ioways, and Missouri band of Sacks and Foxes, fully
understanding the subject, and well satisfied from the
local position of the lands in question, that they never
can be made available for Indian purposes, and that an
attempt to place an Indian population on them, must
inevitably lead to collisions with the citizens of the
United States; and further believing that the extension
of the State line in the direction indicated would have
a happy effect, by presenting a natural boundary between
the whites and Indians; and willing, moreover,
to give the United States a renewed evidence of our
attachment and friendship, do hereby for ourselves,
and on behalf of our respective tribes, (having full
power and authority to this effect,) forever cede, relinquish,
and quit claim, to the United States, all our
right, title, and interest of whatsoever nature in, and
to, the lands lying between the State of Missouri and
the Missouri river; and do freely and fully exonerate
the United States from any guarantee; condition or
limitation, expressed or implied, under the treaty of
Prairie du Chien aforesaid, or otherwise, as to the
entire and absolute disposition of the said lands, fully
authorizing the United States to do with the same
whatever shall seem expedient or necessary.</p>

<p>As a proof of the continued friendship and liberality
of the United States towards the Ioways and band
of Sacks and Foxes of the Missouri, and as an evidence
of the sense entertained for the good will manifested
by said tribes to the citizens and Government of the
United States, as evinced in the preceding cession or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
relinquishment, the undersigned, William Clark, agrees
on behalf of the United States, to pay as a present to
the said Ioways and band of Sacks and Foxes, seven
thousand five hundred dollars in money, the receipt
of which they hereby acknowledge.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 2</span></h4>

<p>As the said tribes of Ioways and Sacks and Foxes,
have applied for a small piece of land, south of the
Missouri, for a permanent home, on which they can
settle, and request the assistance of the Government
of the United States to place them on this land, in a
situation at least equal to that they now enjoy on the
land ceded by them: Therefore I, William Clark, Superintendent
of Indian Affairs, do further agree on
behalf of the United States, to assign to the Ioway tribe,
and Missouri band of Sacks and Foxes, the small strip
of land on the south side of the Missouri river, lying
between the Kickapoo northern boundary line and the
Grand Nemahar river, and extending from the Missouri

<p class="indent"><i>Articles of agreement and convention made and concluded

day of May, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four,
by George W. Manypenny, commissioner on
the part of the United States, and the following-named

Nan-chee-ning-a, or No Heart; Shoon-ty-ing-a, or
Little Wolf; Wah-moon-a-ka, or the Man who Steals;
and Nar-ge-ga-rash, or British; they being thereto
duly authorized by said tribe.</i></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 1</span></h4>

<p>The Ioway tribe of Indians hereby cede, relinquish,
and convey to the United States, all their right, title,
and interest in and to the country, with the exception
hereinafter named, which was assigned to them by the
treaty concluded with their tribe and the Missouri
band of Sacs and Foxes, by William Clark, superintendent
of Indian affairs, on the seventeenth of September,
one thousand eight hundred and thirty-six,
being the upper half of the tract described in the second
article thereof, as &#8220;the small strip of land on the
south side of the Missouri River, lying between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Kickapoo northern boundary-line and the Grand Nemahaw
River, and extending from the Missouri back
westwardly with the said Kickapoo line and the Grand
Nemahaw, making four hundred sections; to be divided
between the said Ioways and Missouri band of
Sacs and Foxes; the lower half to the Sacs and Foxes,
the upper half to the Ioways,&#8221; but they except and
reserve of said country, so much thereof as is embraced
within and designated by the following metes
and bounds, viz: Beginning at the mouth of the Great
Nemahaw River where it empties into the Missouri;
thence down the Missouri River to the mouth of Noland&#8217;s
Creek; thence due south one mile; thence due
west to the south fork of the Nemahaw River; thence
down the said fork with its meanders to the Great
Nemahaw River, and thence with the meanders of said
river to the place of beginning, which country, it is
hereby agreed, shall be the future and permanent
home of the Ioway Indians.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 2</span></h4>

<p>In consideration of the cession made in the preceding
article, the United States agree to pay in the manner
hereinafter prescribed, to the Ioway Indians, all
the moneys received from the sales of the lands which
are stipulated in the third article hereof, to be surveyed
and sold&#8212;after deducting therefrom the costs
of surveying, managing, and selling the same.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 3</span></h4>

<p>The United States agree to have surveys made of the
country ceded by the Ioways in article first in the same
manner that the public lands are surveyed, and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
soon as it can conveniently be done; and the President,
after the surveys shall have been made and approved,
shall proceed to offer said surveyed land for sale, at
public auction, being governed therein by the laws of
the United States respecting sales of public lands; and
such of said lands as may not be sold at public sales,
shall be subject to private entry in the manner that
private entries are made of United States land; and
all the land remaining unsold after being for three
years subject to private entry at the minimum Government
price, may by act of Congress, be graduated
and reduced in price until the whole is disposed of,
proper regard being had, in making such reduction, to
the interests of the Ioways and the speedy settlement
of the country. Until after the said land shall have
been surveyed, and the surveys approved, no white
persons or citizens shall be permitted to make thereon
any location or settlement; and the provisions of the
act of Congress, approved on the third day of March,
one thousand eight hundred and seven, relating to
lands ceded to the United States, shall, so far as they
are applicable, be extended over the lands herein ceded.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 4</span></h4>

<p>It being understood that the present division-line
between the Ioways and the Sacs and Foxes of Missouri,
as run by Isaac McCoy, will, when the surveys
are made, run diagonally through many of the sections,
cutting them into fractions; it is agreed that
the sections thus cut by said line, commencing at the
junction of the Wolf with the Missouri River, shall
be deemed and taken as part of the land herein before
ceded and directed to be sold for the benefit of the
Ioways, until the quantity thus taken, including the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
before-recited reservation, and all the full sections
north of said line, shall amount to two hundred sections
of land. And should the Sacs and Foxes of
Missouri consent to a change of their residence and be
so located by the United States as to occupy any portion
of the land herein ceded and directed to be sold
for the benefit of the Ioways, west of the tract herein
reserved, the Ioways hereby agree to the same, and
consent to such an arrangement, upon the condition
that a quantity of land equal to that which may be
thus occupied by the Sacs and Foxes, and of as good
quality, shall be set apart for them out of the country
now occupied by the last-named tribe, contiguous to
said division-line, and sold for their benefit as hereinbefore
provided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article 5</span></p>

<p>As the receipts from the sales of the lands cannot
now be determined, it is agreed that the whole subject
shall be referred to the President of the United States,
who may, from time to time, prescribe how much of
the proceeds thereof shall be paid out to the Ioway
people, and the time and mode of such payment, and
also how much shall be invested in safe and profitable
stocks, the principal of which to remain unimpaired,
and the interest to be applied annually for the civilization,
education, and religious culture of the Ioways
and such other objects of a beneficial character as
may be proper and essential to their well-being and
prosperity: provided, that if necessary, Congress may,
from time to time, by law, make such regulations in
regard to the funds arising from the sale of said lands,
and the application thereof for the benefit of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Ioways, as may in the wisdom of that body seem just
and expedient.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 6</span></h4>

<p>The President may cause the country the Ioways
have reserved for their future home, to be surveyed,
at their expense, and in the same way as the public
lands are surveyed, and assign to each person or
family such portion thereof as their industry and
ability to manage business affairs may, in his opinion,
render judicious and proper; and Congress may hereafter
provide for the issuing to such persons, patents
for the same, with guards and restrictions for their
protection in the possession and enjoyment thereof.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 7</span></h4>

<p>Appreciating the importance and the benefit derived
from the mission established among them by the
board of foreign missions of the Presbyterian Church,
the Ioways hereby grant unto the said board a tract
of three hundred and twenty acres of land, to be so
located as to include the improvements at the mission,
and also a tract of one hundred and sixty acres of
timbered land, to be selected by some agent of the
board from the legal subdivisions of the surveyed
land; and the President shall issue a patent or patents
for the same, to such person or persons as said board
may direct. They further grant to John B. Roy,
their interpreter, a tract of three hundred and twenty
acres of land, to be selected by him in &#8220;Wolf&#8217;s
Grove,&#8221; for which the President shall also issue a
patent.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 8</span></h4>

<p>The debts of Indians contracted in their private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
dealings as individuals, whether to traders or otherwise,
shall not be paid out of the general fund.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 9</span></h4>

<p>As some time must elapse before any benefit can
be derived from the proceeds of the sale of their
land, and as it is desirable that the Ioways should at
once engage in agricultural pursuits and in making
improvements on the tract hereinbefore reserved for
them, it is hereby agreed that, of the fund of one
hundred and fifty-seven thousand five hundred dollars,
set apart to be invested by the second clause of
the second article of the treaty concluded on the
nineteenth day of October, one thousand eight hundred
and thirty-eight, a sum not exceeding one hundred
thousand dollars shall be paid to the Indians,
or expended under the direction of the President for
the erection of houses, breaking and fencing lands,
purchasing stock, farming utensils, seeds, and such
other articles as may be necessary for their comfort.
Fifty thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may be
deemed expedient, to be paid during the year commencing
on the first of October, one thousand eight
hundred and fifty-four; and the other fifty thousand
dollars, or so much thereof as shall be deemed expedient,
to be paid during the year commencing on
the first of October, one thousand eight hundred and
fifty-five. The residue of said fund of one hundred
and fifty-seven thousand five hundred dollars on hand
after the payments herein provided for have been made
shall remain as a trust fund, the interest upon which,
as well as the interest that may have accrued on the
portion drawn out, shall be applied, under the di<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>rection
of the President, to educational or other beneficial
purposes among the Ioways.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 10</span></h4>

<p>It is agreed that all roads and highways laid out
by authority of law shall have a right of way through
the lands herein reserved, on the same terms as are
provided by law when roads and highways are made
through the lands of citizens of the United States;
and railroad companies, when the lines of their roads
necessarily pass through the lands of the Ioways, shall
have right of way on the payment of a just compensation
therefor in money.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 11</span></h4>

<p>The Ioways promise to renew their efforts to suppress
the introduction and use of ardent spirits in
their country, to encourage industry, thrift, and morality,
and by every possible effort to promote their
advancement in civilization. They desire to be at
peace with all men, and they bind themselves to commit
no depredation or wrong upon either Indians or
citizens; and whenever difficulties arise they will abide
by the laws of the United States, in such cases made
and provided, as they expect to be protected and to
have their rights vindicated by them.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 12</span></h4>

<p>The Ioway Indians release the United States from
all claims and demands of every kind and description
arising under former treaties, and agree to remove
themselves within six months after the ratification
of this instrument, to the lands herein reserved for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
their homes; in consideration whereof, the United
States agree to pay to said Indians five thousand
dollars&#8212;two thousand of which with such portion
of balances of former appropriations of interest-fund
as may not now be necessary under specific heads,
may be expended in the settlement of their affairs
preparatory to removal.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 13</span></h4>

<p>The object of this instrument being to advance the
interests of the Ioway people, it is agreed, if it prove
insufficient, from causes which cannot now be foreseen,
to effect these ends, that the President may, by
and with the advice and consent of the Senate, adopt
such policy in the management of their affairs, as,
in his judgment, may be most beneficial to them; or
Congress may hereafter make such provision by law
as experience shall prove to be necessary.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article 14</span></h4>

<p>This instrument shall be obligatory on the contracting
parties whenever the same shall be ratified
by the President and the Senate of the United States.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">11</span></a> Considerable controversy has taken place as to the actual
meaning of this word. Various suggestions have been made,
more generally by local writers, and in the confusion it is difficult
to come to a final decision. The latest authorities prefer
Gray Snow, and the task would be considerable to enumerate
all those who have written on the subject. W. W. Hildreth in
<i>Annals of Iowa</i>, April, 1864, gives the derivation from
the Omaha word Py-ho-ja, or &#8220;Grey Snow.&#8221; It has been
claimed that the word is of Dakota origin and that it was
written by the French Aiouez (see Charlevoix, 1723) and that
its anglicization was gradual. The present meaning of <i>Iowa</i>
in the Dakota is &#8220;something to write or paint with.&#8221; Schoolcraft
is authority for the statement that the tribes called themselves
Pa-ho-ches, meaning &#8220;Dusty Nose,&#8221; or &#8220;Dirty Face,&#8221;
and Foster in the text emphasizes this point. One writer
boldly asserts that the word Iowa is a corruption from
Kiowa, and Antoine Le Claire, the celebrated half-breed interpreter,
stated that the word in his tongue signified &#8220;this is the
place.&#8221; Taylor Pierce, long connected with the trading post
of Fort Des Moines, testified in favor of <i>Kiowa</i>, giving it the
same definition as last named. Fulton (<span class="smcap">Red Men of Iowa</span>)
mentions certain writers who interpreted the word as &#8220;beautiful.&#8221;
W. E. Richey (<span class="smcap">Memoirs of the Exploration of the
Basin of the Mississippi Valley</span>, Volume VII, 1903) says,
&#8220;I feel inclined to think that the word <i>Iowa</i> came from
Harahey....&#8221; For a full discussion of this subject see
<i>Annals of Iowa</i>, April, 1864, and July, 1896.</p></div>

section between the present southern boundary of Iowa and
lower Minnesota on the east, and along the southern bank of
the Missouri river to the westward. Catlin&#8217;s Map of 1833
places this tribe in the southwestern portion of the State of

The tribal circle, each segment composed of a clan, gens or
band, made a living picture of tribal organization and responsibilities.
The usual opening through the circle was toward
the east, which calls to mind religious rites and obligations of
an earlier people, being further exemplified in the position
which was usually given to the ceremonial tents. See A. C.

<i>passim</i>. Throughout all of the American tribes of savagery it
has been found that peculiar groups of persons are organized and
known as shamanistic societies or phratries, viz: banded religious
bodies. The term however must be extended that it may include
the ceremonies which the savage believed to be religious. Peace
and warfare, health and disease, welfare and want, pleasure and
pain, all, whether good or evil, are believed to be under control of
such societies as noted. The gens is to be found in Greek and
Roman history, where it is known as the agnatic kindred. The
tribe remains a body of consanguineal kindred: it is composed of
groups of gentes that are incest groups, and the mates in marriage
must belong to different gentes. See <a href="#Page_45">appendix A.</a></p></div>

by Mr. Stewart Culin in his recent work, <span class="smcap">Games of
the North American Indians</span>: (24th Rep., B. A. E., 1907),
and to this volume we refer any student who wishes to make
detailed researches. In addition to this work, Catlin&#8217;s great
contribution to the history of the North American tribes is in
itself a mine of general information, though his little volume
entitled <span class="smcap">The Fourteen Ioway Indians</span>, published in London
in 1844, treats of the games of the Iowa more particularly.
Where possible the earlier edition of that writer&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Letters and

colored plates, such method of illustration having been condemned
by Catlin from the beginning. <span class="smcap">Indian Games an Historical

born October 29, 1682, at St. Quentin, died, 1761. His most
important work of American interest bears the following title:
<span class="smcap">Histoire et Description Generale de la Nouvelle France,
Avec le Journal Historique d&#8217;un Voyage Fait Par Ordre
Du Roi Dans L&#8217;Amerique Septentrionale</span>. Paris, 1744.
Several editions of the work, in three and six volumes respectively,
were issued in Paris during this year. <span class="smcap">Journal d&#8217;un
Voyage</span> (<span class="smcap">ETC.</span>), usually forms the last volume, with a separate
title page. During 1761 this portion was published in English
in London, two volumes, but it was not until 1865-72 that
the <span class="smcap">Histoire</span> proper was translated, and at that time by J. G.
Shea (New York, 6 vols.). Foster is obviously in error as to
the date mentioned (1722). Charlevoix&#8217;s work was not ready
for publication at that time, though he had no doubt finished
it in 1724, at which date he issued simultaneously, the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>
which was addressed to the Duchess de Lesdigui&egrave;res. Some
partial reprints of Charlevoix do not contain the linguistic portions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55"><span class="label">55</span></a> Here the writer no doubt refers to the mutilated and
meretricious issue of the Lewis and Clark <span class="smcap">Journals</span>, published
by William Fisher of Baltimore during 1812. As a contribution
to the literature of the subject, the volume is entirely devoid
of worth and statements concerning linguistics or events have
little value. Coues, in his edition of the Lewis and Clark
<span class="smcap">Travels</span>, gives full details of this publication. See also the
present writer&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Bibliography of the Lewis and Clark Expedition</span>,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56" id="Footnote_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56"><span class="label">56</span></a> It is difficult to determine exactly the work here referred

Foster had access to Rev. S. R. Riggs&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Grammar and Dictionary
of the Dakota Language</span>, published by the Smithsonian
Institution as one of the Contributions to Knowledge,
in 1852. Dr. Riggs was a close student of Siouan linguistics
and published much material on the subject, his <span class="smcap">Dakota-English
Dictionary</span> being exhaustively edited with great care
by J. O. Dorsey and published in final form in 1892 by the
Bureau of American Ethnology. A comprehensive list of the
published and manuscript material by Riggs, who was ably
assisted by his wife, will be found in Pillings&#8217;s <span class="smcap">Siouan Bibliography</span>,
page 60 <i>et seq.</i>, and in the <span class="smcap">S. D. Hist. Coll.</span>, Vol.

acknowledges his indebtedness to the first volume of the <span class="smcap">Minn.

tribe at an earlier date than here mentioned. Father Louis
<span class="sidenote"><b>Andr&eacute;, 1676</b></span>
Andr&eacute;, who came to Canada during 1669, and
was at Green Bay, Wis., from 1671 to 1681,
designates the Nadoessi Mascouteins, which name
was applied to the Iowa because of their relations for a time
with the Sioux, as living about 200 leagues from that place,
in 1676. (See article by Father A. E. Jones, in <i>U. S. Cath.
Hist. Mag.</i>, No. 9, 1889). Father Andr&eacute; died in Quebec in 1715.
<span class="sidenote"><b>Membr&eacute;, 1680</b></span>
Even before the date of Le Sueur we have a
reference by Father Zenobius Membr&eacute; in
1680, placing the Oto and Iowa in three great
villages built near a river &#8220;which empties in the river Colbert
[Mississippi] on the west side above the Illinois, almost opposite
the mouth of the Wisconsin.&#8221; More than this he appears
to locate a part of the Ainove (no doubt Aioue) to the
west of the Milwaukee river in Wisconsin.
<span class="sidenote"><b>Perrot, 1685</b></span>
Perrot (<span class="smcap">Memoirs</span>), apparently locates them, in
1685, on the plains in the vicinity of the Pawnee.
Marquette&#8217;s map of 1674-79 gives the Pahoutet (Iowa), Otontanta
(Oto), Maha (Omaha) a position on the Missouri river,
but this is done by mere chance and without authority. La
Salle, writing Hennepin August 22, 1682, mentions both Oto
and Iowa under Otontanto and Aiounonea.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_61" id="Footnote_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61"><span class="label">61</span></a> It has often been a matter for conjecture why Le Sueur
should have given himself so much concern over a mine of
&#8220;green earth&#8221; as the discovery does not seem to be one meriting
a great amount of distinction. Not long since, however, certain
mineral specimens of metallic substance, apparently a sort
of iron or copper ore, were found in the banks of the Le Sueur
river (so-called by J. N. Nicollet, and on a map published in
1773, the river St. Remi), near the confluence with the Blue
Earth river. Penicaut in his relation speaks of the deposit
extending many miles on the banks of the river (<span class="smcap">Minn. Hist.
Soc. Coll.</span>, Vol. III, page 8), and it is therefore not improbable
that the intrepid explorer had in mind something more real
than colored marls of blue, green or yellow, which owed their
color to the silicate of iron, and which were, when free from
sand, highly prized and used for paint by the Indians. As an
article of trade they were of value, but even this point does not
fully explain the expedition. (See MS. in <i>Ministere des Colonies</i>,
Paris, Vol. XV, c. 11, fol. 39). In a letter from the Intendant
Champigny to the French Minister, also in this collection
in Paris, the former says, &#8220;I think that the only mines
that he (Le Sueur) seeks in those regions are mines of beaver
skins.&#8221; For a lengthy sketch of the material first referred to,

gained their confidence and good-will from the beginning. He
was born in 1644 and employed by the Jesuits from 1660-65,
later connecting himself with the Ottawa fur-trade. He is
probably better known, however, as an explorer, and in 1685
was employed by the government of Canada as commandant in
the northwest. During his last years he composed his <span class="smcap">Memoirs</span>

Sieur d&#8217; Bienville together with his brother were leaders in that
conflict with the English in the Hudson Bay region (see Winsor,
<span class="smcap">Narrative and Critical History</span>, Vol. IV), and it is not exaggeration
to term Pierre le Moyne, Sieur d&#8217;Iberville, as one of
the most noted Canadian naval officers of his time. His death
occurred from yellow fever, July 9, 1706, at Havana. <i>Cf.</i> <span class="smcap">The

Le Sueur came to Canada as a young man and became a fur
trader. During 1693 and for a few years thereafter he was
commandant at Chequamegon and discovering lead mines on the
upper Mississippi he made efforts to secure permission to work
them, but without success. Little is known of his last years and
his death occurred while on the ocean, probably before 1710.</p></div>

&#8220;The manuscript from which the above Map was prepared,
was found in the &#8216;Bibliotheque du roi,&#8217; in Paris in a volume
of La Harpe&#8217;s journeys of 1718-1722. It is said to bear date
the year 1700. If so, it is evident that after the original preparation
and before publication some one has added matter subsequently
ascertained, for the Map above contains items of as
late a date as 1717. Also is to be noted the fact that while all
the other parts of the Map are in the French language, one
single English phrase is to be found in the lower right-hand
corner, to-wit: &#8216;De Soto landed 31 May, 1538.&#8217; This would
indicate that some one other than the original draftsman had
taken part in its creation and at a time subsequent to its original
preparation.&#8221;

</p><p>
Pierre Esprit Radisson was a native of St. Malo in Brittany
and in 1651 settled with his parents at Three Rivers on the
St. Lawrence. Medard Chouart, Sieur des Groseilliers, was born
in Brie, France, though the exact dates in both cases are not
known. It is supposed that these two adventurers died in
Great Britain at an advanced age as they had served in the
interest of the French and British as policy dictated. In the
Minnesota monograph above referred to, Mr. Benjamin Sulte,
one of the leading Canadian authorities on the early French
explorations, gives in detail a vast amount of highly important
material concerning the Radisson-(Chouart) Groseillers connection
and a more popular though somewhat biased exposition
of the same subject is given by Miss Agnes C. Laut in her
<span class="smcap">Pathfinders of the West</span>, part I.
</p><p>
Radisson&#8217;s highly important account of his wanderings are
in manuscript in The Bodleian Library, and include the record
of his first four voyages, including two journeys westward in
company with Groseilliers, and his subsequent Hudson Bay experiences
are in the British Museum. In 1885 <i>The Prince Society</i>
of Boston published the work in its entirety and to the lasting
benefit of American history.

of the northwest. Coming to Canada as an officer
from France about 1676 he conducted an expedition against
the Sioux in 1678 and a year later took formal possession of
their country for France. He spent several years as an explorer
and fur trader, and in 1689 returned to the St. Lawrence.
His death occurred in 1710. See <span class="smcap">Minn. Hist. Coll.</span>, Vol. I.
His name is spelled Du Luth, Du Lut, Dulhut, De Luth, Dulud
and Du Luhd in the old documents. The city of Duluth, St.
Louis Co., Minnesota, founded in 1856, was named after the
explorer at the suggestion of Rev. J. G. Wilson of Logansport,
Indiana. See Stennett, <span class="smcap">History of the Origin of the Place

Michel Maray, sieur de Chauvignerie, an interpreter

<p>The A. L. A. BOOKLIST describes it thus (November, 1909):
&#8220;A concise and sympathetic account in simple language of the life, habits,
customs, mythology, etc., of one of the most interesting of the North American
tribes, with a chapter on their history since the Spanish conquest.
The author is a member of the Indian service, has had several years&#8217; experience
with the tribe and knows his subject. Appendix contains official
letters and affidavits relating to conditions on the reservations and the causes
of the Navajo war of 1861. Illustrated from photographs, but unfortunately
unindexed.&#8221;</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
